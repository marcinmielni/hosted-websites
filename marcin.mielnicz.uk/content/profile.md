Hi, my name is Marcin and I'm a begginer programmer. My fields of intrest are:

## DevOps

this approach involves multiple stages from development and operations side of things. 
It can speed up development of software and is compatible with agile methodology. 
Thanks to CI/CD pipelines work can be done in parallel by various members of the team. 
Proper testing can mitigate risk of deploying faulty software to production server, and developer can commit changes anytime. 
This all makes for many incremental improvements and makes DevOps a truly agile way of making software.

This website is made by utilizing such tools as Git and Jenkins. Although I am the only person working on this webpage, amount of time from commit to deploy is reduced to almost zero.
